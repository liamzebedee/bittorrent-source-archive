InternetExplorer users:  You must launch BitTorrent with InternetExplorer NOT RUNNING in order to register as a helper app.  This only needs to be done once.

Mozilla:  restart Mozilla after launching BitTorrent for the first time.

OmniWeb:  OmniWeb doesn't seem to pay attention to InternetConfig.  Just double-click the .torrent file in the download panel or otherwise open the .torrent file to get things started.
